Online Retail Sales Data Analysis

Objective:
To analyze online retail sales data through data cleaning, revenue trends, and profit margin insights using Microsoft Excel

Insights
The South and East regions generated the highest total revenue, indicating strong customer bases.
Several products such as Hair Dryer, Resistance Bands, and Electric Kettle had a Profit Margin above ₹5000, marking them as high-profit items.
No missing or dirty data — shows good data quality from the source.

Outcomes
Successfully used VLOOKUP and INDEX/MATCH to retrieve order-specific information.
Created a PivotTable to summarize revenue by region and used Conditional Formatting to highlight top performers.
Identified the top 3 most profitable products, useful for marketing or stock prioritization.
Built a revenue trend line chart, providing clear visual insights

 Trend
Revenue remained low to moderate during the first 20 days.
A sharp increase in revenue after Day 24, peaking on Day 30, suggests end-of-month purchasing behavior or sales campaigns.
Some zero-revenue days suggest days with no orders or operational breaks.

Prediction
If current patterns continue, end-of-month sales will remain peak periods — offering a chance to launch discounts or ads.
Focused inventory planning around top-performing products and regions can improve profitability.
Products with consistently high profit margins can be targeted for up-selling or bundling strategies

 Conclusion:
This project demonstrates strong skills in Excel functions, pivot tables, charts, and data analysis. The insights could help a retail company optimize promotions and inventory by
understanding revenue patterns and profit-driving products.
